# **Evalution Test**

**Problem Set 1 - Regex**

1. Write a regex to extract all the numbers with orange color background from the below text in italics (Output should be a list).

   **{"orders":[{"id":1},{"id":2},{"id":3},{"id":4},{"id":5},{"id":6},{"id":7},{"id":8},{"id":9},{"id":10},{"id":11},{"id":648},{"id":649},{"id":650},{"id":651},{"id":652},{"id":653}],"errors":[{"code":3,"message":"[PHP Warning #2] count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable (153)"}]}**

Solution:

```
import re

errorMessage = """{"orders":[{"id":1},{"id":2},{"id":3},{"id":4},{"id":5},{"id":6},{"id":7},{"id":8},{"id":9},{"id":10},{"id":11},{"id":648},{"id":649},{"id":650},{"id":651},{"id":652},{"id":653}],"errors":[{"code":3,"message":"[PHP Warning #2] count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable (153)"}]}"""

numbers = [ int(re.findall(r'\d+',num)[0]) for num in re.findall(r'{"id":\d+}', errorMessage)]
print(numbers)
```

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653]

**Problem Set 3**

**A.** Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours). Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?

**Answer :**

For scheduling periodic tasks like downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours, I chose **Celery with Celery Beat** because it's easy to integrate with Django, scales well, and is reliable. However, it can become complex to manage at scale and may be resource-intensive.

If more scalability or complex task orchestration is needed, I recommend considering **Apache Airflow** for advanced workflows or
**Kubernetes Cron Jobs** for containerized environments. For serverless setups, **AWS Lambda with EventBridge** is a cost-effective alternative.

**B.** In what circumstances would you use Flask instead of Django and vice versa?

**Answer :**

The choice ultimately depends on our projectâ€™s specific needs, development timeline, and the level of control or structure we prefer.
Use Flask for smaller, more flexible applications where you want to hand-pick our components and have full control over the stack.
Use Django for larger, feature-rich applications where built-in tools and rapid development are priorities.
